#LIRI-Bot
In this assignment, we were asked to make a LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Used with Twitter, Spotify and OMDB APIs.

Made so liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

my-tweets - Displays tweets from connected Twitter account.

spotify-this-song - Displays various Data about Song inputed as well as a 30 second clip.

movie-this - Displays various Data about any inputed Movie.

do-what-it-says - fs.readFile command taking text from text file and using it on Terminal Window.
